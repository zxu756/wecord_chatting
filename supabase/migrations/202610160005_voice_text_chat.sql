-- Text chat in voice channels: every voice channel already has its own
-- conversation (created with the channel, with every circle member in
-- it), so its messages, unread counts, mentions and notifications work
-- like a text channel's. Only the send trigger refused them; now voice
-- channels take messages, with the same view / send permissions, timeouts
-- and slowmode as text channels. Forum channels still take messages only
-- in their posts.

-- Same as 202610130028_voice_channels, without refusing voice channels.
